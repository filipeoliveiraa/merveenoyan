<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Merve</h1>


I'm a 25 years old Machine Learning practitioner based in Istanbul. I'm pursuing my master's in Data Science while working as a Developer advocate at Hugging Face. In the past, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for over 2 years, working in various problems, ranging from Sales Prediction to Natural Language Understanding. Currently you'll find me doing integrations, doing TensorFlow maintenance and releasing tutorials for Hugging Face around here. I'm actively contributing to Google's ML ecosystem. I'm also researching in morphologically rich languages, particularly Turkish. In 2020, I became Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning. Check out my podcast [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-KsNFmnZ_v3RZ7MKvCzDg). I stream and post computer science and machine learning tutorials occasionally to my YouTube and twitch.
